a
If d['bananas'] is meant, then the response is 35
Otherwise it is a keyerror because banana is in the dictionary, not bananas

b
4

c
True

d
keyerror because pears is not in the dictionary

e
0 because .get returns zero if key is not found in dictionary

f
['apples', 'bananas', 'grapes', 'oranges'] because they have been sorted alphabetically

g
It is false.  Apples is not in d since it was just deleted and dictionaries are mutable.
